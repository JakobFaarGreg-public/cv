## Text
### Type Scale
12px, 14px, 16px, 18px, 20px, 24px, 30px, 36px, 48px, 60px, 72px

### Font
Montserrat, Oxygen, Play, Space Grotesk

### Characters per line
More than 45-75 characters in a line makes text hard to read.
This means their containers should have widths of about 20-35em

### Align different text sizes
To keep a nice alignment between different text sizes keep them aligned at the baseline.
The baseline is the line upon which the font rests.

### Line height
The wider a paragraph the higher the line-height. Short lines use 1.5, longer kan use 2.
Note, the larger the font size, the less line-height is needed.

### Centering text
Text blocks longer than 2-3 lines should be left-aligned. 
Numbers in a table should be right-aligned
